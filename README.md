# StrawHat

Utility package, it's just the representation of ***Conway's Law***. There
is some modules for Error handling and GraphQL (for now ğŸ˜…). Probably will be
breaking down to more than one package in the future if this keep growing too
much. For now, it is easier for us to maintain.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:straw_hat, "~> 0.0.11"}
  ]
end
```
